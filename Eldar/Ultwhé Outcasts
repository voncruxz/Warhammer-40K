The birth of the Moonlight Lances herald from *INSERT NAME HERE*, an excellent engineer. After leaving the Ultwhé Craftworld many many years ago he travelled with a lot of different Aeldari groups. He slowly gathered knowledge of the subtle differences in the technology used by Harlequins, Drukhari and Corsairs. This let him eventually develop a new jetbike design which he brought with him when returning to Eldrad Ulthrans splinter of Ultwhé.
The new designs were quickly adopted by a fervent shrine of the Shining Spears, named the Moonlight Lances. They see themselves as the shining light in middle of the darkness, symbolic for the rising Chaos. They fight without remorse against the forces of Chaos.
